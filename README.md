# CalTrain Schedule

This CalTrain Schedule was posted to the [symbian freeware site](http://www.freeware-symbian.com/s80-7-0-device-1769/caltrain-schedule-timetable-for-javaphone-download-29145.html) and is from Grassroot Innovation.

In this project, we've written a CT-GTFS parser to updated the schedule data
and added an icon.
